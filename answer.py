Engineering is a stream of science that has helped humans shape the world and will continue to do so. As the author tells us, engineering is the application of science to solve real-word problems, and engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are problem solvers who use their expertise in science. As we trace back in time, we can easily see the influences of engineers, past and present, on the world we are living in. Engineers are the special spectrum of people who take delight in creating order from disorder and move the world forward.Engineering is a broad field that is divided into various disciplines and sub-disciplines, but there exist only six main categories: mechanical engineering, civil engineering, chemical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical/electronic engineering, and aerospace engineering. Engineers differ from scientists in that they create that which has never been, while scientists investigate that which already is. However, both scientists and engineers complement each other and make contributions to our society.

In the manufacturing industry, 5G improves the flexibility, efficiency and safety of production operations, enabling manufacturers to enhance smart factories. In the energy and utilities industry, 5G provides innovative solutions to various areas in energy management and widens the potential application of smart grids. In the retail industry, the extremely fast data speeds will enhance the mobile shopping experience, and develop innovative ways of customer engagement that incorporate AR/VR technologies. In the financial services, 5G could accelerate a number of mobile operations and assist in real-time data transmission. In the media and entertainment industry, 5G revolutionizes many areas via the exponential increase in the download speed and unprecedented virtual consumption experience. In the healthcare industry, not only will 5G be capable of handling the massive data load, but it will also facilitate the remote monitoring devices and remote surgery procedures. In the transportation industry, 5G offers new insights into smart transportation systems such as V2V and V2I communications. In the education industry, 5G has the potential to transform traditional educational methods and enrich classroom learning experience by leveraging AR/VR technologies particularly in high-risk educational settings. In the cloud computing, 5G’s low latency and high throughput could improve cloud computing experience. In the public safety industry, 5G could enhance public safety capabilities thereby improving emergency response and information sharing."]],

Arts, with the assistance of AI, now can be tailored to popular tastes. In the gaming industry, AI releases human from mundane tasks so that people can focus on more creative ones.

According to McKinsey, there are quite a few urban mobility problems in all major cities in Europe—pollution, traffic congestion, increasing road fatalities, cybersecurity risks, citizens with limited mobility options and in “transport poverty”, just to name a few.Fortunately, various solutions have sprung up. In such fields as mobility as a service, sustainable travel behavior, traffic management, traffic congestion and micromobility management, European companies design and launch state-of-the-art products to help improve mobility with the latest advance in technologies. Through innovative efforts the city of Lublin in Poland was recognized as “Smart City of the Year 2015 with population between 100, 000 and 350,000” for investments in the traffic management system and solutions in collective transport. The HiReach project funded under Europe’s Horizon 2020 program is committed to the reduction of transport poverty.All these promise a future when residents and visitors enjoy a wider range of affordable, multimodal, on-demand mobility options and the benefits brought by the elimination of road fatalities, improvement in travel times and reduction of air pollution."]],

With the power of computing tools, computers have become more than just manufacturing tools, but have evolved into indispensable thinking tools. With their unique logic, computers can solve more and more human problems. The main difference between the way we think and the way computers solve problems is that our brain was never hard-wired for big data. When dealing with too many facts and data, we have to compress them into shorter notations or adopt the method of classification. It may lead to the loss of information in the process. Compared with humans, computers are superior in computation and data processing and they can search without sorting. Because of these properties, in the field of architecture, computers can notate every brick of a building and micro-design each minute particle of a building, which may save plenty of building material, energy, labor and money and can deliver buildings that are better fit to spec. Although computers have advantages over humans in big data, no machine-learning system can optimize all parameters of a design process in the meantime, only designers can. Coping with computer’s way of thinking will be the challenge of postindustrial design, but fears of competition coming from Artificial Intelligence may be unnecessary."]],

            "Thanks to digital technologies, the smart cities of the future offer their inhabitants the comforts of metropolitan living combined with the benefits of rural life and returning to cities has been an option of people who once moved to the countryside. What changes have taken place in urban life? First of all, in big cities, smart buildings become a norm. Each building is networked to the eaves and embedded within City Intelligent Platforms, which are used to process vast volumes of data from sensor networks. All the information constitutes a virtual digital ecosystem that administers itself. Meanwhile, the building has become a high-performance energy supplier. People can store energy from the solar panels on the fa?ade and wind generators on the roof. As global networking expanded, people could do almost everything at home. While this reduces emissions, it makes people lonely and unhappy. The advent of holographic studio solves the problem. It helps people to meet and eat in the virtual space. In addition, self-service system is everywhere. For example, when the ingredients for a cake in the bakery are out of stock, the autonomous supply vehicle can fill up itself without receiving instructions. All in all, the development of science and technology, along with the popularity of the Internet have made life convenient in many ways and improve people’s quality of life."]],
